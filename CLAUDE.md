# Project Instructions for Claude

## Task Management

**CRITICAL**: At the start of EVERY new conversation session, IMMEDIATELY:
1. Check `./.claude/tasks.md` for existing tasks
2. If open tasks exist, print the task and current step with proper formatting:
   - Use clear section headers
   - Include line breaks between sections
   - Format status information clearly
3. If there are no open tasks, state "No tasks are planned currently"

**IMPORTANT**: Always follow the task management workflow defined in `./.claude/workflow.md`.
