# E2E Testing with MCP Browser Tools

This demonstrates end-to-end testing using the MCP Playwright tools instead of complex Laravel Dusk setup.

## Test 1: Welcome Page Basic Functionality
```bash
# Navigate to app
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate http://localhost:8000

# Take screenshot
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot

# Verify content
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
```

## Test 2: Responsive Design Testing
```bash
# Test desktop view
mcp__playwright__browser_resize 1200 800
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot

# Test mobile view  
mcp__playwright__browser_resize 375 667
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
```

## Test 3: User Registration Flow (Future)
```bash
# Navigate to register page
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate http://localhost:8000/register

# Fill registration form
mcp__playwright__browser_type name "Test User"
mcp__playwright__browser_type email "test@example.com"
mcp__playwright__browser_type password "password123"

# Submit form
mcp__playwright__browser_click "Register button"

# Verify redirect to dashboard
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
```

## Advantages of MCP Tools vs Laravel Dusk:
1. **No setup required** - Works immediately
2. **Visual feedback** - Can see page snapshots
3. **Real browser** - Uses actual Playwright/Chrome
4. **Debugging friendly** - Can take screenshots anytime
5. **No driver management** - No ChromeDriver installation
6. **Cross-platform** - Works on any system

## Running Tests:
Just use the MCP tools directly in conversation - no separate test runner needed!
