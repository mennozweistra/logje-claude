# Add Requirements Command

Add one or more new requirements to the project requirements document based on user input.

**FIRST**: Read and understand the current requirements structure by reviewing `./.claude/requirements.md` to understand:
- Existing requirement categories and organization
- Current feature scope and functionality
- Writing style and format used for requirements
- Existing user stories and acceptance criteria patterns

**THEN**: Analyze the user's request to add requirements by:

1. **Understanding the Request**: Carefully analyze what the user wants to add
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If the request is unclear or incomplete, ask specific questions such as:
   - What is the primary goal or user need this addresses?
   - Who are the intended users (end users, admins, etc.)?
   - What are the expected user workflows or interactions?
   - Are there any specific technical constraints or preferences?
   - How should this integrate with existing features?
   - What are the acceptance criteria for completion?

3. **Make Suggestions**: Offer suggestions to improve or complete the requirements:
   - Propose related functionality that might be needed
   - Suggest user experience improvements
   - Recommend technical considerations
   - Identify potential edge cases or error scenarios

4. **Iterate Until Complete**: Continue asking questions and making suggestions until you have a complete understanding of:
   - The functional requirements
   - The user stories with clear acceptance criteria
   - Integration points with existing features
   - Technical specifications if needed

**FINALLY**: Once you have complete understanding, update `./.claude/requirements.md` by:
- Adding the new requirements in the appropriate section
- Following the existing format and style
- Including comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria
- Ensuring consistency with existing requirements
- Adding any necessary cross-references to related features

**IMPORTANT**: Do not add incomplete or unclear requirements. Always ensure you fully understand what the user needs before updating the requirements document.
