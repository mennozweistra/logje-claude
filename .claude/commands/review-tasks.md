# Fix and Improve Tasks

**FIRST**: Read and understand the project structure by reviewing:
- `./.claude/workflow.md` - to understand task management standards and requirements
- `./.claude/requirements.md` - to understand current project requirements  
- `./.claude/architecture.md` - to understand architectural guidelines

**THEN**: Review and **fix** all incomplete tasks in `./.claude/tasks.md` by making the necessary improvements directly to the tasks file.

**FIX THESE ISSUES** in tasks where found:
- Update tasks that don't align with current `requirements.md`
- Improve implementation plans that lack detail or proper step breakdown
- Enhance test plans that are missing comprehensive coverage
- Fix task dependencies and ordering problems
- Break down tasks that exceed the target duration specified in `workflow.md`
- Update task structure to match the format defined in `workflow.md`

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Actually edit `./.claude/tasks.md` to fix the problems you find. Don't just report - make the improvements.

**SUMMARY**: After making changes, provide a brief summary of what tasks were improved and what specific fixes were made.
