# Plan Tasks from Requirements

**FIRST**: Read and understand the current project state by reviewing:
- `./.claude/requirements.md` - to understand all project requirements
- `./.claude/tasks.md` - to see what tasks already exist and their current status
- `./.claude/workflow.md` - to understand task creation standards

**THEN**: Analyze the requirements and identify any missing tasks needed to fulfill them.

**CREATE TASKS** for any requirements that are not covered by existing tasks:
- Review each requirement section systematically
- Identify gaps between requirements and existing task coverage
- Create new tasks following the workflow standards (use Last Task Number for sequencing)
- Break down complex requirements into manageable tasks (consider target duration)
- Ensure tasks have proper implementation and test plans
- Set appropriate dependencies between related tasks

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Follow the task structure and procedure defined in `workflow.md`.

**SUMMARY**: After making changes, provide a brief summary of what requirements were analyzed and what new tasks were created to address gaps.
