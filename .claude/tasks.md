### [✅] 61 - Fix Measurement Time Override Bug
- **Status**: Completed

This likely affects all measurement types. Fix this bug in the measurement saving logic and add feature tests to prevent regression.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Investigate measurement saving logic in MeasurementModal component
  2. [x] Check if time field is being properly captured from user input - BUG CONFIRMED!
  3. [x] Identify where time is being overwritten (model, controller, or component)
  4. [x] Fix the time preservation logic for both create and update operations
  5. [x] Ensure time validation still works (no future times, proper format)
  6. [x] Test fix with all measurement types (Weight, Glucose, Exercise, Notes, Medication, Food)
  7. [x] Create feature test to verify time preservation works correctly
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test creating new measurement with custom time (not current time)
  2. [x] Test editing existing measurement to change time to different value
  3. [x] Verify time preservation works for all measurement types
  4. [x] Test edge cases: past times, current time, invalid formats
  5. [x] Confirm time validation still prevents future times
  6. [x] Run feature test to ensure no regression
  7. [x] Test on both desktop and mobile interfaces
- **Root Cause**: The `Measurement` model's `$fillable` array was missing `'created_at'`, causing Laravel's mass assignment protection to ignore explicitly set timestamps
- **Solution**: Added `'created_at'` to the `$fillable` array in `app/Models/Measurement.php:25`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/Models/Measurement.php` - Added `'created_at'` to fillable array
  - `tests/Feature/MeasurementTimePreservationTest.php` - Created comprehensive test suite
- **Testing**: Verified with automated tests and manual browser testing - time preservation now works correctly

  3. [ ] Measurement reorder testing is superficial (string checking vs actual ordering logic)
  4. [ ] Missing specific glucose 0-12 mmol/L range validation tests (Task 58)
  5. [ ] Medication measurement testing missing from retrospective coverage
- **Additional Implementation Required**:
  1. [x] Add UI-level time preservation tests using Livewire component testing (6 tests added to MeasurementTimePreservationTest.php)
  2. [x] Expand FoodMeasurement/CrudTest.php with editing, deletion, validation tests (11 comprehensive tests, 1 skipped due to application bug)
  3. [x] Add specific glucose range validation tests for 0-12 mmol/L to ValidationTest.php (5 boundary and range tests added)
  4. [x] Improve MeasurementReorderTest.php to verify actual ordering logic (4 tests with improved logic, ordering issue documented)
