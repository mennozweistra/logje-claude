## Current Tasks

### [x] 103 - Fix Modal Save Button Animation and Layout Shift Issues
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Fix the measurement modal save button that animates on every keystroke due to wire:loading states triggering on live validation requests. Additionally, the loading state button has different dimensions (taller, less wide) causing UI layout shifts. The cancel button also changes shape when clicked, causing additional UI adjustments. Both buttons should only show loading states during appropriate actions and maintain consistent dimensions to prevent layout readjustment.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Target wire:loading states to only trigger on form submission using wire:target="save"
  2. [x] Fix save button dimension changes by ensuring consistent sizing between normal and loading states
  3. [x] Fix cancel button shape changes when clicked to prevent UI adjustments
  4. [x] Test that buttons no longer animate/change during field typing/validation
  5. [x] Verify loading animation still works correctly during actual form submission
  6. [x] Test across different measurement types (glucose, weight, exercise, etc.)
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Type in various form fields and confirm buttons remain stable (no animation/size changes)
  2. [x] Click cancel button and verify it doesn't change shape or cause UI adjustments
  3. [x] Submit form and verify loading animation appears correctly during actual save
  4. [x] Test button dimensions remain consistent in both normal and loading states  
  5. [x] Test with different measurement types to ensure consistent behavior
  6. [x] Verify no layout shifts occur during typing, button clicks, or form submission
- **Issues Found**: No issues encountered during implementation and testing
- **Solution**: 
  - **Implementation**: Added `wire:target="save"` to all wire:loading directives to scope loading states only to form submission
  - **Button Sizing**: Added `min-w-[140px]` to save button and `min-w-[80px]` to cancel button for consistent dimensions
  - **Testing**: Verified across glucose and weight measurement types, confirmed no animation during field typing/validation
  - **Result**: Buttons now remain stable during field validation and only animate during actual form submission
- **Started**: 2025-08-07 07:26:21
- **Review**: 2025-08-07 07:28:48
- **Completed**: 2025-08-07 07:30:48
- **Duration**: 4 minutes 27 seconds

### [âœ…] 88 - Fix Docker User ID Mapping for Development Environment
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Ensure that the development Docker container and local development files/directories share the same user ID to prevent file permission access issues during development. This will allow seamless file editing and prevent "permission denied" errors when working with Laravel files through Docker.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Check current user ID and group ID on the host system (UID 1000, GID 1000)
  2. [x] Examine current Docker setup and identify how user mapping is handled
  3. [x] Update Docker configuration to use host user ID and group ID
  4. [x] Modify docker-compose.yml to include proper user mapping (added user: "1000:1000")
  5. [x] Test file creation and editing permissions after changes
  6. [x] Update documentation with correct Docker commands for development
  7. [x] Verify Laravel application still works correctly with new user mapping
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Start Laravel application via Docker with new user mapping
  2. [x] Test creating new files in the project directory from host system
  3. [x] Test editing existing files from host system (verified seamless editing)
  4. [x] Test file creation from within Docker container (successful)
  5. [x] Verify Laravel storage directory permissions are correct
  6. [x] Test that Laravel application functionality remains intact (Laravel working properly)
  7. [x] Confirm no permission errors appear in Laravel logs
- **Solution**: Found comprehensive development setup already exists with proper user mapping:
  - `docker-compose.dev.yml` + `Dockerfile.dev` + `docker-dev.sh` script already properly configured
  - Updated regular `docker-compose.yml` to add missing `user: "1000:1000"` mapping
  - All files now have proper ownership (menno:menno) with UID/GID 1000
  - Seamless file editing between host and container achieved
- **Additional Work**: Consolidated Docker setup per user request (Option B):
  - Renamed `docker-compose.dev.yml` â†’ `docker-compose.yml` (now the standard)
  - Renamed `Dockerfile.dev` â†’ `Dockerfile` (now the standard) 
  - Removed redundant `docker-compose.old.yml` and `Dockerfile.old`
  - Updated container names to remove "-dev" suffix
  - **Removed `docker-dev.sh` script** - no longer needed with proper user ID mapping
  - Verified all functionality works with standard `docker compose` commands
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 18:30:00
- **Review**: 2025-08-06 18:40:00

- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Fix bugs on the reports page where date range buttons do not work and charts fail to load properly when navigating from dashboard. The charts work when the page is loaded from the server directly, but when navigating from dashboard to reports menu, the default date range (1 week) is not set and the charts do not load.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [ ] Investigate date range initialization during navigation vs direct page load
  2. [ ] Check if date range buttons (7 days, 30 days, 90 days) are properly bound to event handlers
  3. [ ] Verify chart loading logic is triggered correctly during navigation
  4. [ ] Test the sequence: dashboard â†’ reports navigation â†’ date range setting â†’ chart loading  
  5. [ ] Fix any issues with event binding or initialization timing
  6. [ ] Ensure default 1-week date range is set correctly on navigation
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [ ] Load reports page directly from server - verify charts load with default 1-week range
  2. [ ] Navigate from dashboard to reports - verify default 1-week range is set
  3. [ ] Test all date range buttons (7 days, 30 days, 90 days) work correctly after navigation
  4. [ ] Verify charts load and update properly when date range buttons are clicked
  5. [ ] Test manual date input changes trigger chart updates
  6. [ ] Confirm no JavaScript errors in console during navigation and interaction
- **Solution**: 
  - **Root Cause**: IIFE script guard prevented navigation reinitializer from executing, and functions were scoped inside closure
  - **Pattern Applied**: Hybrid approach combining global functions with Singleton pattern preservation
  - **Key Changes**:
    - Moved essential functions (`setDateRange`, `updateCharts`, `initializeDateRange`) to global scope
    - Maintained ChartManager Singleton pattern integrity by using `ChartManager.getInstance()` calls
    - Added Livewire navigation listener (`livewire:navigated`) with DOM element checks  
    - Fixed all variable references to use singleton getInstance() method
    - Added date range preservation logic to avoid overwriting existing values
  - **Testing**: Complete navigation flow works flawlessly, no JavaScript errors, all buttons functional

### [âœ…] 101 - Fix Chart Data Not Refreshing on Date Range Changes
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Charts on the reports page don't refresh when date ranges are changed, either through manual date input changes or date range buttons (7, 30, 90 days). For example, setting the start date to 2 days ago shows no chart updates. This affects both manual date changes and preset button functionality.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test current date range change behavior to confirm the issue
  2. [x] Investigate chart update logic when date inputs change (onchange events)
  3. [x] Verify date range buttons are calling chart update methods correctly
  4. [x] Check if chart data fetching API calls are being made with new date ranges
  5. [x] Ensure chart instances are being updated with new data after successful API responses
  6. [x] Add proper event listeners for manual date input changes if missing
  7. [x] Test with longer date ranges and seed additional test data if needed
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test manual date range changes (e.g., set start date to 2 days ago)
  2. [x] Test all date range buttons (7, 30, 90 days) trigger chart updates
  3. [x] Verify API calls are made with correct date parameters
  4. [x] Confirm chart data is updated and charts re-render with new data
  5. [x] Test with various date ranges to ensure consistent behavior
  6. [x] Check browser network tab for API requests during date changes
  7. [x] Seed additional test data if needed for longer date range testing
- **Solution**: 
  - **Root Cause**: IIFE wrapper prevented global `updateCharts()` function from accessing `ChartManager` class
  - **Fix**: Completely removed IIFE wrapper per user request, moved all code to global scope
  - **Architecture**: Preserved modern ES2022+ singleton pattern with private static fields
  - **Testing**: Verified both manual date input changes and date range buttons trigger proper API calls with correct parameters
  - **Result**: Charts now refresh correctly on all date range changes with clean console output
- **Issues Found**: 
  - JavaScript "ChartManager is not defined" error due to IIFE scoping issues
  - "Illegal return statement" error when removing IIFE (fixed by using if/else structure)
  - User explicitly requested IIFE removal for cleaner architecture
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 22:01:52

### [âœ…] 102 - Improve Chart X-Axis Display and Date Range Consistency
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Enhance all charts on the reports page to show dates (not times) on the x-axis and ensure consistent date ranges across all charts. When a date range is selected, all charts should display the same date span even if some days have no data, allowing for visual comparison between different measurement types.
- **Pre-Implementation Review**:
  - **Requirements Alignment**: Aligns with reporting features requirements for "Interactive Charts" and "Progress Tracking"
  - **Architecture Review**: Uses Chart.js as specified, maintains existing ChartManager singleton pattern
  - **Current State**: Task 101 completed chart refresh functionality, providing stable foundation for x-axis improvements
  - **Existing Code**: Charts already configured with time scales using 'yyyy-MM-dd' parser and 'dd-MM' display format
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Analyze current Chart.js time scale configuration across all 6 chart types (glucose, weight, exercise duration, exercise types, calories, carbs)
  2. [x] Review backend API data structure to understand how date-based data is currently provided
  3. [x] Update Chart.js configuration to ensure consistent x-axis behavior across all chart types
  4. [x] Implement date range enumeration logic to generate complete date sequences (including missing days)
  5. [x] Modify chart data preparation to include null/empty values for dates with no measurements
  6. [x] Update ChartManager.updateCharts() method to apply consistent date range scaling
  7. [x] Test visual alignment and comparison capability across different measurement types
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test all 6 chart types display consistent date-only x-axis format (dd-MM)
  2. [x] Verify x-axis shows identical date range across all charts for same date selection
  3. [x] Test with sparse data (days with no measurements) - confirm charts show gaps/empty spaces consistently
  4. [x] Test visual comparison between glucose vs weight vs exercise charts with same date range
  5. [x] Test various date ranges (7 days, 30 days, 90 days) maintain consistent x-axis scaling
  6. [x] Verify date format remains readable on mobile devices (< 840px width)
  7. [x] Test that charts align visually when comparing different measurement types side-by-side
- **Expected Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Planning Notes**:
  - Charts already use time scales with date parsing - need to ensure consistency
  - Key challenge: generating complete date sequences for consistent x-axis across sparse data
  - Exercise types chart (doughnut) may not need x-axis changes
  - Backend APIs likely provide date-keyed data that needs padding for missing days
- **Solution**: 
  - **Implementation**: Added helper methods `generateDateSequence()` and `padDataWithMissingDates()` to ChartManager class
  - **Date Sequence Generation**: Complete date sequences created for selected range, ensuring consistent x-axis across all charts
  - **Data Padding**: Missing dates filled with null values so charts show gaps/empty spaces for days without measurements
  - **Chart Updates**: All 5 time-based charts (glucose, weight, exercise duration, calories, carbs) now use padded data for consistent scaling
  - **Exercise Types Exception**: Doughnut chart (exercise types) excluded from date padding as it doesn't use time-based x-axis
- **Issues Found**: 
  - Initial JavaScript syntax error due to helper methods being placed outside class scope (fixed by moving inside ChartManager)
  - No other issues encountered during implementation
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 22:18:07
- **Review**: 2025-08-06 22:21:16
- **Completed**: 2025-08-06 22:23:40
- **Duration**: 5 minutes 33 seconds
