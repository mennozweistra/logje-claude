## New Feature Development - Healthy Day Indicator

### [x] 113 - Create Healthy Day Rules Service  
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Create a service class to evaluate healthy day rules based on user's daily measurements. The service needs to implement time-based rule evaluation for current day (only checking rules that have become active) and complete evaluation for past dates. Rules include medication timing, glucose measurement counts, and exercise logging requirements.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Create `app/Services/HealthyDayService.php` with base structure and rule evaluation methods
  2. [x] Implement medication counting logic (track Metformine taken twice, other medications once)  
  3. [x] Implement glucose measurement counting with fasting flag validation
  4. [x] Implement exercise activity checking
  5. [x] Create time-based rule activation logic (rules become active at specific times)
  6. [x] Add method to evaluate all rules for a given date and user
  7. [x] Add method to get detailed rule status (active/inactive, met/unmet) for modal display
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Unit test medication counting (single occurrence vs double occurrence for Metformine)
  2. [x] Unit test glucose measurement counting with fasting flag requirements
  3. [x] Unit test time-based rule activation (rules only active after specified times)
  4. [x] Unit test complete rule evaluation for past dates vs partial for current day
  5. [x] Unit test edge cases (no measurements, partial compliance, full compliance)
  6. [x] Test with sample user data matching the seven health rules
- **Started**: 2025-08-07 22:32:19
- **Review**: 2025-08-07 22:40:09
- **Completed**: 2025-08-07 22:41:53
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

### [ ] 114 - Create Health Indicator Livewire Component

  6. [ ] Add Livewire listener for measurement updates to refresh status
  7. [ ] Create component view `resources/views/livewire/health-indicator.blade.php`
  8. [ ] Implement smiley display logic (ðŸ˜Š for healthy, ðŸ˜” for not healthy)
  9. [ ] Create modal layout with rule list, checkmarks, crosses, and greyed out inactive rules
- **Test Plan**:
  1. [ ] Unit test component initialization and property setup
  2. [ ] Feature test modal toggle functionality 
  3. [ ] Feature test real-time updates when measurements change
  4. [ ] Feature test correct smiley display based on rule compliance

- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. [ ] Update Dashboard Livewire component to pass selectedDate to health indicator
  2. [ ] Modify dashboard view template to include health indicator next to day name
  3. [ ] Add CSS styling for proper positioning and responsive design
  4. [ ] Ensure indicator updates when user navigates between dates
  5. [ ] Connect measurement save events to trigger health indicator refresh
  6. [ ] Test integration with existing dashboard filters and date navigation
  7. [ ] Ensure mobile responsive positioning of indicator
- **Test Plan**:
  1. [ ] Feature test health indicator appears on dashboard next to day name
  2. [ ] Feature test indicator updates when navigating between dates
  3. [ ] Feature test indicator refreshes when measurements are added/edited/deleted
  4. [ ] Browser test responsive design on mobile and desktop
  5. [ ] Browser test visual integration with existing dashboard layout
  6. [ ] Feature test indicator works correctly with dashboard filters

### [ ] 116 - Add Health Rule Modal Functionality
