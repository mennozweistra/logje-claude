## Current Tasks

### [âœ…] 88 - Fix Docker User ID Mapping for Development Environment
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Ensure that the development Docker container and local development files/directories share the same user ID to prevent file permission access issues during development. This will allow seamless file editing and prevent "permission denied" errors when working with Laravel files through Docker.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Check current user ID and group ID on the host system (UID 1000, GID 1000)
  2. [x] Examine current Docker setup and identify how user mapping is handled
  3. [x] Update Docker configuration to use host user ID and group ID
  4. [x] Modify docker-compose.yml to include proper user mapping (added user: "1000:1000")
  5. [x] Test file creation and editing permissions after changes
  6. [x] Update documentation with correct Docker commands for development
  7. [x] Verify Laravel application still works correctly with new user mapping
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Start Laravel application via Docker with new user mapping
  2. [x] Test creating new files in the project directory from host system
  3. [x] Test editing existing files from host system (verified seamless editing)
  4. [x] Test file creation from within Docker container (successful)
  5. [x] Verify Laravel storage directory permissions are correct
  6. [x] Test that Laravel application functionality remains intact (Laravel working properly)
  7. [x] Confirm no permission errors appear in Laravel logs
- **Solution**: Found comprehensive development setup already exists with proper user mapping:
  - `docker-compose.dev.yml` + `Dockerfile.dev` + `docker-dev.sh` script already properly configured
  - Updated regular `docker-compose.yml` to add missing `user: "1000:1000"` mapping
  - All files now have proper ownership (menno:menno) with UID/GID 1000
  - Seamless file editing between host and container achieved
- **Additional Work**: Consolidated Docker setup per user request (Option B):
  - Renamed `docker-compose.dev.yml` â†’ `docker-compose.yml` (now the standard)
  - Renamed `Dockerfile.dev` â†’ `Dockerfile` (now the standard) 
  - Removed redundant `docker-compose.old.yml` and `Dockerfile.old`
  - Updated container names to remove "-dev" suffix
  - **Removed `docker-dev.sh` script** - no longer needed with proper user ID mapping
  - Verified all functionality works with standard `docker compose` commands
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 18:30:00
- **Review**: 2025-08-06 18:40:00
- **Completed**: 2025-08-06 18:45:00
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
