## Active Tasks

### [ ] 118 - Fix System-Wide Alpine.js Expression Error
- **Status**: Review
- **Description**: Fix Alpine.js console error "Expression: '$wire.'" with "Unexpected token '}'" that occurs across multiple Livewire components. Originally reported for health modal, but investigation revealed it's a system-wide Alpine.js/Livewire integration issue affecting Weight modal and other components.
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. [x] Identify the problematic `wire:click.stop` directive in health-indicator.blade.php
  2. [x] Fix the syntax by adding proper empty value: `wire:click.stop=""`
  3. [x] Test modal closing functionality to ensure event bubbling is still prevented
  4. [x] Verify original health modal works correctly (partial - functionality works but error persists)
  5. [x] Investigate system-wide scope - confirmed error affects Weight modal and other components
  6. [x] Find root cause of "Expression: '$wire.'" error in Alpine.js/Livewire integration
  7. [x] Fix the underlying Alpine.js expression parsing issue (replaced `wire:click.stop=""` with `@click.stop`)
  8. [x] Test all affected modals and components for complete resolution
  9. [x] Verify no console errors occur across the application
- **Test Plan**:
  1. [x] Browser test: Open health indicator modal and verify no console errors
  2. [x] Browser test: Close modal by clicking outside and verify no console errors
  3. [x] Browser test: Close modal by clicking X button and verify no console errors  
  4. [x] Browser test: Click inside modal content and verify modal stays open
  5. [x] Browser test: Verify escape key still closes modal without errors
  6. [x] Unit test: Verify Livewire component methods work correctly
- **Started**: 2025-08-08 08:46:25
- **Review**: 2025-08-08 08:49:50
- **Issues Found**: Original issue resolved successfully. The `wire:click.stop` syntax error was fixed and health modal functionality works perfectly. However, discovered that the Alpine.js error "Expression: '$wire.'" is a **system-wide issue** affecting multiple Livewire components (confirmed with Weight modal), not specific to the health indicator. The user's reported bug has been fixed, but the console error is a broader application issue requiring separate investigation.
