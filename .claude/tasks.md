### [✅] 61 - Fix Measurement Time Override Bug
- **Status**: Completed

This likely affects all measurement types. Fix this bug in the measurement saving logic and add feature tests to prevent regression.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Investigate measurement saving logic in MeasurementModal component
  2. [x] Check if time field is being properly captured from user input - BUG CONFIRMED!
  3. [x] Identify where time is being overwritten (model, controller, or component)
  4. [x] Fix the time preservation logic for both create and update operations
  5. [x] Ensure time validation still works (no future times, proper format)
  6. [x] Test fix with all measurement types (Weight, Glucose, Exercise, Notes, Medication, Food)
  7. [x] Create feature test to verify time preservation works correctly
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test creating new measurement with custom time (not current time)
  2. [x] Test editing existing measurement to change time to different value
  3. [x] Verify time preservation works for all measurement types
  4. [x] Test edge cases: past times, current time, invalid formats
  5. [x] Confirm time validation still prevents future times
  6. [x] Run feature test to ensure no regression
  7. [x] Test on both desktop and mobile interfaces
- **Root Cause**: The `Measurement` model's `$fillable` array was missing `'created_at'`, causing Laravel's mass assignment protection to ignore explicitly set timestamps
- **Solution**: Added `'created_at'` to the `$fillable` array in `app/Models/Measurement.php:25`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/Models/Measurement.php` - Added `'created_at'` to fillable array
  - `tests/Feature/MeasurementTimePreservationTest.php` - Created comprehensive test suite
- **Testing**: Verified with automated tests and manual browser testing - time preservation now works correctly

### [✅] 62 - Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) Functionality
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Implement PWA functionality to make the health tracking app installable as a Progressive Web App with proper manifest.json, service worker, and installation prompts. This will allow users to install the app on their devices for a native app-like experience.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Create web app manifest (manifest.json) with app metadata, icons, and display settings
  2. [x] Generate app icons in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512, etc.) for various device screens
  3. [x] Create service worker for basic caching strategy and offline functionality
  4. [x] Add manifest link and service worker registration to main layout
  5. [x] Implement PWA installation prompt/banner for supported browsers
  6. [x] Configure PWA display mode (standalone) and theme colors
  7. [x] Test PWA installation on desktop and mobile browsers
  8. [x] Verify PWA meets installability criteria (HTTPS, manifest, service worker)
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Verify manifest.json is accessible and properly formatted
  2. [x] Test app icon displays correctly in browser install prompts
  3. [x] Verify service worker registers and caches basic resources
  4. [x] Test PWA installation on Chrome desktop (install banner appears)
  5. [x] Test PWA installation on mobile browsers (Android Chrome, iOS Safari)
  6. [x] Verify installed app launches in standalone mode (no browser UI)
  7. [x] Test app functionality works when launched as installed PWA
  8. [x] Verify PWA meets Lighthouse installability requirements

  4. [x] Update Docker compose/run commands to use correct user mapping
  5. [x] Test file editing permissions after Docker changes
  6. [x] Document correct Docker commands for development workflow
  7. [x] Verify Laravel application still works correctly with new permissions
  8. [x] Update development documentation with permission solution
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Start Laravel via Docker with new configuration
