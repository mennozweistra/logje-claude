## Current Tasks

### [âœ…] 88 - Fix Docker User ID Mapping for Development Environment
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Ensure that the development Docker container and local development files/directories share the same user ID to prevent file permission access issues during development. This will allow seamless file editing and prevent "permission denied" errors when working with Laravel files through Docker.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Check current user ID and group ID on the host system (UID 1000, GID 1000)
  2. [x] Examine current Docker setup and identify how user mapping is handled
  3. [x] Update Docker configuration to use host user ID and group ID
  4. [x] Modify docker-compose.yml to include proper user mapping (added user: "1000:1000")
  5. [x] Test file creation and editing permissions after changes
  6. [x] Update documentation with correct Docker commands for development
  7. [x] Verify Laravel application still works correctly with new user mapping
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Start Laravel application via Docker with new user mapping
  2. [x] Test creating new files in the project directory from host system
  3. [x] Test editing existing files from host system (verified seamless editing)
  4. [x] Test file creation from within Docker container (successful)
  5. [x] Verify Laravel storage directory permissions are correct
  6. [x] Test that Laravel application functionality remains intact (Laravel working properly)
  7. [x] Confirm no permission errors appear in Laravel logs
- **Solution**: Found comprehensive development setup already exists with proper user mapping:
  - `docker-compose.dev.yml` + `Dockerfile.dev` + `docker-dev.sh` script already properly configured
  - Updated regular `docker-compose.yml` to add missing `user: "1000:1000"` mapping
  - All files now have proper ownership (menno:menno) with UID/GID 1000
  - Seamless file editing between host and container achieved
- **Additional Work**: Consolidated Docker setup per user request (Option B):
  - Renamed `docker-compose.dev.yml` â†’ `docker-compose.yml` (now the standard)
  - Renamed `Dockerfile.dev` â†’ `Dockerfile` (now the standard) 
  - Removed redundant `docker-compose.old.yml` and `Dockerfile.old`
  - Updated container names to remove "-dev" suffix
  - **Removed `docker-dev.sh` script** - no longer needed with proper user ID mapping
  - Verified all functionality works with standard `docker compose` commands
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 18:30:00
- **Review**: 2025-08-06 18:40:00
- **Completed**: 2025-08-06 18:45:00
- **Duration**: 15 minutes

- **Started**: 2025-08-06 20:00:00
- **Solution**: 
  - **Primary Issue**: Mobile navigation had incorrect items (Dashboard, Reports + only Food) instead of matching desktop dropdown
  - **Fixed**: Removed Dashboard and Reports from mobile menu, added missing Medicines link
  - **Result**: Mobile now shows exact same 4 items as desktop: Profile, Food, Medicines, Log Out
  - **Verified**: Hamburger menu toggle works correctly, responsive behavior intact, desktop unchanged
- **Review**: 2025-08-06 19:55:43
- **Completed**: 2025-08-06 20:14:13

### [âœ…] 91 - Add Escape Key Modal Close Functionality
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Implement keyboard accessibility by allowing users to close modals using the Escape key. When a modal is visible, pressing the Escape key should close the modal with the same behavior as clicking the [x] close button.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Identify all modal components in the application
  2. [x] Examine current modal close functionality (X button behavior)
  3. [x] Add keyboard event listener for Escape key on modal components
  4. [x] Ensure Escape key triggers the same close method as X button
  5. [x] Test that Escape key works when modal is focused/visible
  6. [x] Verify Escape key only affects visible modals (not hidden ones)
  7. [x] Test keyboard accessibility across different modal types
  8. [x] Ensure no conflicts with other keyboard shortcuts
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test Escape key closes measurement modals (add/edit)
  2. [x] Verify Escape key works for all modal types in the application
  3. [x] Test that Escape key only works when modal is visible
  4. [x] Confirm Escape key doesn't interfere with other keyboard interactions
  5. [x] Verify modal close animation/behavior is identical to X button click
- **Solution**: 
  - **Implementation**: Added Alpine.js keyboard event listeners to both measurement modal and delete confirmation modal
  - **Event Handler**: `x-on:keydown.escape.window="$wire.cancel()"` triggers the same Livewire method as X button
  - **Scope**: Applied to both main measurement form modal and delete confirmation modal
  - **Testing**: Verified Escape key works across all measurement types (Weight, Glucose, Food, etc.)
  - **Compatibility**: X button functionality remains unchanged, no conflicts with other keyboard interactions
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 20:01:50

### [âœ…] 92 - Limit Modal Width for Large Displays
- **Status**: Review
- **Description**: On huge displays, the modals are too large and take up too much horizontal space. Limit the modal width to be smaller than the content area of the app for better visual proportion and usability on large screens.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Examine current modal sizing in measurement-modal.blade.php
  2. [x] Identify current width classes and responsive behavior
  3. [x] Determine appropriate maximum width constraints for large displays
  4. [x] Compare with main content area width to ensure proper proportions
  5. [x] Update modal container classes with appropriate max-width constraints
  6. [x] Test modal width on various screen sizes (desktop, large desktop, ultrawide)
  7. [x] Ensure modal remains responsive on smaller screens
  8. [x] Verify modal content remains readable and properly formatted
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test modal width on large desktop displays (1440px+)
  2. [x] Test modal width on ultrawide displays (1920px+)
  3. [x] Verify modal doesn't exceed content area width
  4. [x] Test modal responsiveness on medium screens (tablet/small desktop)
  5. [x] Test modal on mobile devices remains unchanged and functional
- **Solution**: 
  - **Implementation**: Added `max-w-4xl` constraint to measurement modal container
  - **Sizing Strategy**: Maintains responsive behavior (w-11/12 md:w-3/4 lg:w-1/2) but caps maximum width at 896px
  - **Comparison**: Content area uses `max-w-7xl` (1280px), modal now constrained to smaller `max-w-4xl` (896px)
  - **Testing**: Verified across screen sizes - large displays (1920px), tablet (768px), mobile (375px)
  - **Result**: Better proportions on large displays while preserving mobile responsiveness
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 20:09:26
- **Review**: 2025-08-06 20:12:10

### [âœ…] 93 - Fix Dashboard Column Widths for Better Layout
- **Status**: Review
- **Description**: The first two columns in the dashboard (icon and time) should have fixed width, while the third column (content) should use the remainder of the available space. This will improve the layout consistency and ensure proper alignment of measurement data across different screen sizes.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Locate the dashboard measurement list component and its column structure
  2. [x] Identify current column width classes and layout approach
  3. [x] Apply fixed width classes to the first column (icon column)
  4. [x] Apply fixed width classes to the second column (time column)
  5. [x] Update third column to use flex-grow or remaining space
  6. [x] Test layout on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  7. [x] Ensure consistent alignment across different measurement types
  8. [x] Verify responsive behavior maintains readability
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Test column widths with different measurement types (weight, glucose, food, etc.)
  2. [x] Verify first two columns maintain consistent fixed widths
  3. [x] Confirm third column expands to use remaining space properly
  4. [x] Test layout on mobile devices (< 840px width, e.g. 375px)
  5. [x] Test layout on desktop devices (â‰¥ 840px width, e.g. 1024px+)
  7. [x] Verify text doesn't overflow or wrap unexpectedly
- **Solution**: 
  - **Implementation**: Updated dashboard measurement table with fixed column widths and table-fixed layout
  - **Column 1 (Icon)**: Applied `w-8` class for consistent 32px width
  - **Column 2 (Time)**: Applied `w-12` class for consistent 48px width  
  - **Column 3 (Content)**: Uses `w-auto` with remaining table space for flexible content
  - **Table Layout**: Added `table-fixed` class for consistent column sizing behavior
  - **Testing**: Verified with weight and glucose measurements, tested responsive behavior at 375px and 1024px
- **Started**: 2025-08-06 20:23:56

### [ ] 94 - Redesign Responsive Breakpoints to Clean Two-Size System
- **Status**: Todo
- **Description**: Audit and redesign all HTML templates to use only the two-breakpoint system (mobile < 840px, desktop â‰¥ 840px with `md:` prefix). Replace all `sm:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, and `2xl:` classes with either no prefix (mobile) or `md:` prefix (desktop) to create a clean, consistent responsive design system.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [ ] Audit all files using `sm:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:` breakpoints (83+ usages across 16 files)
  2. [ ] Analyze each usage to determine if it should be mobile (no prefix) or desktop (`md:`)
  3. [ ] Create systematic replacement strategy for each breakpoint type
  4. [ ] Update measurement modal and navigation components first (most critical)
  5. [ ] Update dashboard and reports components  
  6. [ ] Update remaining layout and page components
  7. [ ] Remove legacy breakpoints from Tailwind config after all updates
  8. [ ] Test responsive behavior across all updated components
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [ ] Test all pages at mobile width (< 840px) 
  2. [ ] Test all pages at desktop width (â‰¥ 840px)
  3. [ ] Verify no layout breaks or visual regressions
  4. [ ] Test navigation menu responsive behavior
  5. [ ] Test modal responsive behavior 
  6. [ ] Test dashboard measurement list responsive behavior
  7. [ ] Run browser tests to ensure functionality is preserved
