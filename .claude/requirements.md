# Software Requirements - Logje Health Tracker

This document contains the requirements for the Logje health tracking web application.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
- **Daily Measurement Tracking**: Users can record multiple daily health measurements including:
  - Blood glucose levels (mmol/L, realistic 0-12 range) with optional fasting indicator
  - Weight measurements (kg)
  - Exercise activities (description and duration in minutes)
  - Daily notes (text entries with timestamps)
  - Medication intake tracking (multiple medications per entry from predefined list)
  - Food consumption tracking with nutritional information (calories and carbohydrates)
- **Six Measurement Types**: Complete measurement system with Weight, Glucose, Medication, Food, Exercise, Notes

- **User Authentication**: Simple email/password authentication with secure session management
- **Data Persistence**: Permanent data retention with MySQL database
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Responsive web application for browsers and mobile devices
- **Personal Todo List**: Users can manage their own private todo items with status tracking and detailed views

### Data Entry Interface
- **Default View**: Today's date as default view with Dutch date format (dd-mm-yyyy)
- **Date Navigation**: Users can navigate to any past date for data entry/editing with previous/next buttons
- **Auto-population**: Current time pre-filled for new measurements (editable by user)
- **Time Format Requirements**: All time data entry and display must use military time (24-hour format), Dutch style
  - Time entry format: HH:MM (e.g., 14:30, 09:15, 23:45)
  - Time display format: HH:MM throughout the application
  - Default times must be based on user's local browser timezone, not UTC
  - No AM/PM format - strictly 24-hour military time format
- **Multiple Entries**: Support multiple measurements per type per day
- **Data Validation**: Prevent future date entries with realistic glucose ranges (0-12 mmol/L)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete measurements for any past date
- **Responsive Design**: 6-column grid layout for measurement type buttons, mobile-optimized
- **Filtering System**: Collapsible measurement type filters for dashboard view
- **Time Preservation**: User-entered times are preserved during measurement creation and editing
- **UI Layout Consistency Requirements**: All page layouts must maintain consistent width alignment
  - Dashboard main content area width must match reports page width
  - Both dashboard and reports width must align with top logo and menu width
  - Modal dialogs on dashboard must not extend beyond the main dashboard content area width
  - All width consistency must be maintained across desktop and mobile viewports
  - Conduct mobile responsiveness testing to ensure consistent layout scaling
- **Icon Requirements**: Measurement type icons must be clear and distinguishable
  - Current weight and medicines icons need replacement with more appropriate alternatives
  - All icons should be intuitive and easily recognizable for their measurement types
  - Consider research into alternative icon libraries if current library lacks suitable options
  - Maintain consistent icon style and sizing across all measurement types

### Food Tracking Features

#### Food Database Management
- **User-Specific Food Database**: Each user has their own personal food database
  - Foods are linked to specific users and not shared between accounts
  - Users can only see and manage their own food items
- **Food Maintenance Interface**: Personal food database management functionality
  - Add new foods to personal database with name, description, calories per 100g, carbs per 100g
  - Edit existing food nutritional information for owned foods
  - Delete foods from personal database (only when no food measurements reference them)
  - Searchable list of all personal foods in database for management
  - Foreign key constraint protection: foods cannot be deleted if linked to existing measurements
- **Food Database**: Persistent database with foods and their per-100g nutritional information
  - Each food record contains: name, description (optional), calories per 100g, carbohydrates per 100g
  - Pre-seeded with common foods (fruits, vegetables, proteins, grains, etc.)
  - Searchable food database with auto-complete functionality for consumption tracking

#### Food Consumption Tracking
- **Food Entry System**: Users can log actual food consumption with:
  - Search and select foods from database (separate from food management)
  - Enter actual consumed amount in grams (customizable portions)
  - **Integer-Only Data Entry**: All food amounts must be entered as whole numbers (integers) for simplicity
    - Users enter portions like "150g" not "150.5g" - no decimal input required or allowed
    - UI validation ensures only whole number grams are accepted
    - Internal calculations may use floating point math, but user interface remains integer-based
  - Multiple foods per meal/entry with timestamp
  - Automatic calculation of total calories and carbohydrates based on actual portion size
  - Real-time nutritional information display during entry
- **Nutritional Calculations**: System automatically calculates:
  - Total calories consumed per entry based on actual portion sizes
  - Total carbohydrates consumed per entry based on actual portion sizes
  - Nutritional values displayed in dashboard for daily tracking
- **Food Consumption Workflow**: 
  1. User searches for food item from existing database (e.g., "steak")
  2. Selects food from search results (shows per-100g values as reference)
  3. Enters actual consumed amount in grams (e.g., 220g for steak with 100g reference values)
  4. System calculates actual calories/carbs (e.g., if steak is 250 cal/100g, 220g = 550 cal)
  5. User can add multiple foods to single meal entry
  6. Entry saves with timestamp and total nutritional information

#### Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Food Management**: Administrative function to maintain food database (calories/carbs per 100g)
- **Food Consumption**: User function to log actual food intake with custom portions
- **No Mixing**: Food database management is separate from daily food consumption tracking

### Healthy Day Indicator
- **Real-time Health Status**: Visual indicator on the Health screen showing whether the current day meets health compliance rules
- **Time-based Rule Engine**: Dynamic rule evaluation based on current local time for today, and complete rule evaluation for past dates
- **Visual Feedback System**: 
  - Happy smiley (ðŸ˜Š) when all applicable rules for the current time are met
  - Sad smiley (ðŸ˜”) when one or more applicable rules are not met
  - Indicator positioned next to the day name on the Health screen
- **Interactive Rule Details**: Clicking the health indicator opens a modal popup showing:
  - Complete list of health rules for the day
  - Status of each rule (met/not met) with visual indicators
  - Time-based applicability for current day rules
- **Daily Health Rules** (time-sensitive activation for current day, all apply for past dates):
  - **09:00+**: Rybelsus medication taken (any time after rule activates)
  - **09:00+**: At least one fasting glucose measurement recorded for the day
  - **11:00+**: Metformine, Amlodipine, and Kaliumlosartan medications each taken at least once (can be separate or combined entries)
  - **13:00+**: At least two glucose measurements total recorded for the day (ensures second measurement exists)
  - **14:00+**: Exercise activity logged (any time after rule activates)
  - **18:00+**: At least three glucose measurements total recorded for the day (ensures third measurement exists)
  - **20:00+**: Second Metformine occurrence and Atorvastatine taken (Metformine taken twice total, Atorvastatine taken once)
- **Rule Evaluation Logic**:
  - **Rule Activation**: Time thresholds indicate when rules become active for evaluation, not deadlines
  - **Medication Counting**: System tracks medication occurrence counts (first vs second Metformine intake)
  - **Late Compliance**: Medications/measurements taken after rule activation time still satisfy the rule
  - **Current Day**: Only rules with activation times that have passed are evaluated
  - **Past Days**: All seven rules must be met for the day to be considered healthy
  - **Future Days**: Not applicable (no future date entry allowed)
  - **Daily Reset**: Rules reset at midnight for new day evaluation
- **Rule Status Modal Design**:
  - **Simple Layout**: Clean list of all daily rules with clear visual indicators
  - **Inactive Rules**: Rules not yet activated (time hasn't passed) shown greyed out
  - **Met Rules**: Satisfied rules displayed with green checkmark âœ“
  - **Failed Rules**: Active but unmet rules displayed with red cross âœ—
  - **Real-time Updates**: Modal reflects current status when opened

### Reporting Features
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual reports showing measurement trends over time with Chart.js
- **Nutritional Tracking**: Daily calorie and carbohydrate consumption charts with date range selection
- **Historical Analysis**: Comprehensive data visualization with multiple chart types:
  - Glucose data charts with trend analysis

- Consistent color scheme with health-themed icons (green apple for food, etc.)
- Collapsible filters to reduce visual clutter
- Clear visual feedback for user actions

#### Mobile UI Optimization
- **Compact Mobile Layout**: Mobile interface uses compact design with minimal spacing between UI elements to maximize content display
- **Desktop Spacious Layout**: Desktop interface can use more generous spacing and larger elements for comfortable viewing
- **Minimized Mobile Header**: Header size reduced on mobile devices to preserve screen real estate for content
- **Measurement-Focused Dashboard**: Dashboard prioritizes display of measurement entries over creation controls
- **Repositioned Creation Controls**: Measurement creation buttons moved below measurement entries on mobile to reduce visual prominence and space usage
- **Touch-Friendly Targets**: Maintain appropriate touch target sizes (minimum 44px) while using compact layouts
- **Portrait Mode Optimization**: In portrait orientation, less critical details (such as measurement type labels) may use smaller fonts or be visually de-emphasized
- **Swipe Date Navigation** *(nice-to-have)*: Enable swipe gestures for date navigation on mobile devices

#### User Story: Mobile Dashboard Experience
**As a** mobile user reviewing my daily measurements  
**I want** a compact, focused dashboard interface  
**So that** I can quickly view my measurement data without excessive scrolling or visual clutter  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mobile dashboard displays measurements prominently with minimal spacing
- Header takes up minimal vertical space on mobile screens
- Creation buttons are positioned below measurement entries, not prominently at the top
- Touch targets remain easily tappable (minimum 44x44px)
